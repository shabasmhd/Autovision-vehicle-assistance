# AutoVision – Vehicle Assistance System

AutoVision is an intelligent vehicle assistance system designed to recognize traffic signs in real-time and alert drivers to ensure safer driving. The system uses deep learning and computer vision techniques to detect and classify traffic signs from live video feed and generate corresponding visual or audio alerts.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time traffic sign detection and recognition
- Visual and/or audio driver alerts
- Built using Python, OpenCV, and a custom-trained CNN model
- Dataset: German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)
- Modular codebase for training, testing, and inference

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook


## 📦 Dataset & Model
Due to size limitations, the dataset and trained model weights are available separately:

- 📁 [Download Dataset (GTSRB)]
- 🧠 [Download Trained Model]

## ✅ How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
